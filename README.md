Project Overview: 
Air Pollution Analysis of India's Four Regional Mega Cities - Pre / Post COVID-19

Cities: 
*Chennai, *Delhi, *Mumbai and *Kolkata


Project Abstract:
Each year, India can be found among the countries with the worst levels of air pollution on global indices. The most common such
pollutant measured within this metric is CO (carbon monoxide), while high levels of trace pollutants, such as SO2 (sulfur dioxide),
O3 (ozone), and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), serve to further substantiate evidence of poor regional air quality.

The production of said pollutants can be derived from the combustion of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources, of
which India can be considered a significant global consumer. Currently, India is undergoing a significant lockdown within major
population centers due to COVID. Our data science project seeks to prove a hypothesis that an effective lockdown should lead to a
sizable decrease in pollutants within the regional megacities of Mumbai (West), Delhi (North), Chennai (South), and Kolkata (East).
